# working bank system

NEEDS A LOT OF IMPORVEMENT

- backbone
    functions for navigating
    security checks

- bank account actions
    deposit
    withdraw
    display
    
- different accounts
    * sha256 encryption, a new .txt file for each user
    * change balance and add to history after exiting
    * files should only be readable by server.py

    ID_number file layout
    ---------------
    1 logged in (0/1)
    2 usr - sha256 - salt
    3 balance
    4 history
    --------------
    users.txt
    --------------
    user_names - sha256

- bugs
    after an action if you quit, then all is cancelled
    (login, deposit, CTRL+D, login, display)

# Improvements
- salts for hashes
- networking to connect
    multithreaded
