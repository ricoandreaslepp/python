# working bank system

NEEDS A LOT OF IMPORVEMENT

- backbone
    functions for navigating
    security checks

- bank account actions
    deposit
    withdraw
    display
    
- different accounts
    sha256 encryption, a new .txt file for each user

    change balance and add to history after exiting

    ID_number file layout
    ---------------
    1 usr - sha256
    2 balance
    3-> history
    --------------
    users.txt
    --------------
    user_names - sha256

- bugs
    after an action if you quit, then all is cancelled
    (login, deposit, CTRL+D, login, display)

# Improvements
- salts for hashes

- networking to connect
    multithreaded

- adding colors
- tkinter interface
